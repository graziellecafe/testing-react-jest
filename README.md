# Testing React Jest
Learn best practices for testing your apps with Jest and React Testing Library!

## **React Testing Library** 
- Not just a library, also a philosophy ( "opnionated" )
- Test your software the way users actually use it 
- One is to test your software the way that users actually use it 
- Find elements by accessibility markers, not test IDs
- Provides virtual DOM for tests
- Testes devem passar mesmo que o cÃ³digo tenha mudado

## **Jest** 
- Test runner that 
    - Find tests
    - Run Tests
    - Determines whether tests pass or fail 

### **create-react-app**
- We start create-react-app in order to make a new react application
- npm package 
- creates react application with 
    - configuration 
    - setup webpack and babel 
    - web server 
    - testing library

### npx 
- We will be using `npx` with create-react-app 
- Downloads the latest version of create-react-app templates every time
- Not dependent on when you last installed create-react-app 
- Never installed on your machine! 

### how to initiate the react project 
- `cd name-of-project`
- `npm start`
- and how to test `npm run test`     


### How to create a test 
```js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Breaking down syntax
*render*
- Create virtual DOM for argument JSX - `render(App/)`
- Access virtual DOM via *screen* global - `screen.getByText()`

### Jest assertion
- `expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();`

**Arguments** 
- expect: global method, jest method, starts the assertion
- expect argument (linkElement): subject of the assertion. If meets the expectations
- matcher(toBeInTheDocument()): type of assertion, this matcher comes from Jest-DOM
- matcher argument: () : refines matcher

**More assertion examples**
- `expect(element.textContent).toBe('hello')`; 
- `expect(elementsArray).toHaveLength(7);`

### jest-dom
- install by default: comes with create-react-app
- `src/setupTests.js` imports it before each test, makes matches aavailable: `import '@testing-library/jest-dom';`
- DOM-based matchers: examples: toBeVisible() and toBeChecked()errrd

## Jest 
**React Testing Library helps with** 
- rendering components into virtualDOM
- searching virtual DOM 
- interacting with virtual DOM 
- But needs a test runner that find tests, run them and marke assertions


**Jest**
- is recommended by Testing Library 
- comes with `create-react-app`
- when `npm test` runs an npm script that runs Jest in watch mode
 
### How does Jest Work?
- global test method has two argments:
  - string description 
  - test function
- Test fails if error is thrown when running function 
  - assert throw errors when expectation fails 
- No error -> test pass 
  - Empty tests passes!

## TDD: Test Driven Development
- Write tests before writing code 
  - then write code acoorgind to "spec" set by tests
- red-green testing 
  - tests fails before code is written

  ### Why TDD? 
  - Makes a huge difference in how in feels to write tests
    - part of the codding process, not a "chore"to do at the end 
  - Mode efficient
    - Re-run tests "for free" after changes 

## Types of tests
- Unit tests
  - Tests one unit of code in isolation 
- Integration tests 
  - How multiple units work together 
- Functional Tests
  - Tests a particular function of software
